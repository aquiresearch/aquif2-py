# aquif2-py

This is a Python implementation of the aquif-2 model, which is a chatbot based on Qwen 2.5 that can be used locally.

## Usage

To use the model, you need to have Ollama installed and running on your machine on port 12345. You can find the installation file [here](https://ollama.com/).

Once you have Ollama running, you can run the model by executing the following command:

```bash
py main.py
```

This will make aquif-2 answer the question in the `prompt` variable declared on line 57.
